# Chemical in Cosmetics in the state of California
# Introduction: 
Cosmetics are part of daily life but many contain ingredients that pose serious health risks. This project investigates chemical exposure in personal care products sold in California, using public data to uncover patterns that often go unnoticed.
# Problem statment: 
Between 2009 and 2020, 86.3% of monitored cosmetic products in California contained harmful chemicals. This finding reveals a persistent and unaddressed public health risk, as the vast majority of these dangerous products remain actively sold despite their documented toxicity.
# Key findings:
## 1- what are the top five product category containing harmful chemicals ?
 In this step we aimed to filter our Data by getting top five product category containing harmful chemicals.
## 2- what are top five brands producing the most  products with harmful chemicals?
 In this step we went much deeper into analysis to pinpoint the five major brands responsible for manufacturing the greatest number of products containing these harmful chemicals.
## 3- which toofaced product has the  most harmful chemicals ?
 After we dentified Too Faced as a leading brand of concern in the preceding analysis, this specific step aims to isolate and rank the five individual Too Faced products that contain the highest levels of harmful chemicals. 
## 4- Among the most chemically harmful products, which are currently active and which have been discontinued?
 In this step we are aiming to find out which product are currently active and which have been discontinued.
# Conclusion:
 tooface  being the top brand producing harmful chemicals, with makeup having the most number of carcinogen  specifically (category) out of their products. and has eventually been discontinued.
# Recommendation:
* replace harmful chemical  with safer alternative elements.
* Products that still contain harmful chemicals should be removed from the market.:
* Companies must  practice CSR and ensure safety and sustainability before launching any new products.
# Limitations:
* we may still have unknown harmeful products in the market
